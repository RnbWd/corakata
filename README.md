## Cora Kata

Cora Kata is a word passed down to me from a friend from a friend from a friend. It is that unique something that only YOU have, that only YOU can bring to any situation in life. Your Cora Kata is special. Despite the infinitude of existence, you are unlike any other entity in this multiverse. Express your cora kata, and allow your uniqueness to thrive, because humanity can only thrive if each and every one of us express this from within ourselves and share our cora kata with the world. I now share this word with you, and I hope it catches on, because I really like it.

As we continue to explore the depths of existence, we will need to continually update and expand upon our vocabulary. Take this task upon yourselves, and share your cora kata with the world.

One Love <3
